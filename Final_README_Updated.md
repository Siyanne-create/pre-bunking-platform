# Pre-Bunking Platform

### **Overview**
A pre-bunking tool designed for online news platforms to counter the rapid spread of misinformation in today's fast-paced media environment. While primarily aimed at online news platforms, this tool can also be adapted for broadcast media.

The platform integrates seamlessly with social media platforms, allowing verified updates to be disseminated widely alongside the news websiteâ€™s content.
